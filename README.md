# Solder-Reflow-Hot-Plate
## Course Project EE344: Electronic Design Lab

Project Details:
 -  Recipient of Best Project Award in the Electrical Engineering Department among 200+ students for creating Solder Reflow Hot Plate instrument to solder SMD components 
 -  Engineered a high-performance heating element reaching temperatures up to 300°C, a cooling mechanism capable
    of dropping temperatures at a maximum rate of 3°C/s, and a precision feedback circuit for temperature control
 -  Collaborated within a 3-member team to design an intuitive web interface for configuring reflow profiles, a user-
    friendly TFT LCD display for real-time information, a 3D-printed enclosure and PCB layouts using Eagle
